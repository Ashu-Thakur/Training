### Multiprocessing vs. Multithreading

#### Multiprocessing:
1. **Definition**: 
   - Multiprocessing involves multiple processes, each with its own memory space. Each process runs independently and can be on different CPUs or cores.
2. **Advantages**: 
   - Better for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., mathematical computations).
   - Each process runs in its own memory space, reducing the risk of memory conflicts.
3. **Disadvantages**: 
   - Higher memory usage since each process has its own memory.
   - Inter-process communication (IPC) can be complex and slower.
4. **Implementation**:
   - The `multiprocessing` module in Python allows you to create and manage processes.

#### Multithreading:
1. **Definition**: 
   - Multithreading involves multiple threads within the same process, sharing the same memory space.
2. **Advantages**: 
   - Better for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., reading/writing files, network operations).
   - Lower memory usage as threads share the same memory space.
3. **Disadvantages**: 
   - Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython prevents true parallel execution of threads, limiting performance gains for CPU-bound tasks.
   - Shared memory space can lead to issues such as race conditions.
4. **Implementation**:
   - The `threading` module in Python allows you to create and manage threads.

### What is a Thread?
- **Definition**: A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads can exist within the same process and share the same memory space.
- **Use Cases**: Threads are ideal for I/O-bound tasks like network requests, reading/writing to disk, and user interactions.
- **Execution**: Threads can run concurrently, but due to the GIL in CPython, they do not achieve true parallel execution for CPU-bound tasks.

### What is a Process?
- **Definition**: A process is an independent program in execution, with its own memory space, program counter, and resources. Each process can have multiple threads.
- **Use Cases**: Processes are ideal for CPU-bound tasks that need true parallel execution. Using multiple processes can utilize multiple CPU cores.
- **Execution**: Processes run independently of each other. Communication between processes (IPC) can be achieved through various methods like pipes, sockets, or shared memory.

### Summary
- **Multiprocessing**: Uses multiple processes, each with its own memory. Suitable for CPU-bound tasks. Achieves true parallelism.
- **Multithreading**: Uses multiple threads within the same process, sharing the same memory. Suitable for I/O-bound tasks. Limited by the GIL in CPython.

### Example Code Comparison

#### Multithreading Example
```python
import threading
import time

def print_square(num):
    for i in range(num):
        time.sleep(0.2)
        print(f"Square: {i * i}")

def print_cube(num):
    for i in range(num):
        time.sleep(0.2)
        print(f"Cube: {i * i * i}")

t1 = threading.Thread(target=print_square, args=(5,))
t2 = threading.Thread(target=print_cube, args=(5,))

t1.start()
t2.start()

t1.join()
t2.join()

print("Done with multithreading")
```

#### Multiprocessing Example
```python
import multiprocessing
import time

def print_square(num):
    for i in range(num):
        time.sleep(0.2)
        print(f"Square: {i * i}")

def print_cube(num):
    for i in range(num):
        time.sleep(0.2)
        print(f"Cube: {i * i * i}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_square, args=(5,))
    p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_cube, args=(5,))

    p1.start()
    p2.start()

    p1.join()
    p2.join()

    print("Done with multiprocessing")
```

In summary, choose multithreading for I/O-bound tasks and multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks to make the best use of your system's resources.
